Generics have been introduced in the Go programming language following the
theoretical work by \cite{fg} in \emph{Featherweight Go}. The \emph{Type
Parameters Proposal} \cite{genericsProposal} lists several generic programming
constructs not supported by the initial implementation of generics (as of Go
1.18). Among them is "no parameterization on non-type values such as
constants." The most notable use case of such type parameters would be for
arrays. In Go, the size of an array is part of its type. As such, if the
programmer wishes to write a function that operates on arrays or a data type
that contains arrays, it is necessary to hard-code the size of the
operated/contained array. This imposes a limitation on what abstraction may be
introduced where arrays are concerned. Extending the generic type system in Go
to support constants as type parameters aims to resolve this issue.
