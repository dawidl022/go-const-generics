\section{Monormorphisation from FGGA to Go}

$\Delta$ is an environment mapping numerical type parameters $\alpha_n$ (i.e.
those bound by \kw{const}) to integer literals $n$.

% Formal rules describe process in two distinct stages, whereas implementation
% does both in a single stage (translates as it collects types).

% From the symmetry of the formal rules of the two phases it is clear how this
% can naturally be implemented in a single phase.

% TODO brief summary (one of main technqiues of impl)
