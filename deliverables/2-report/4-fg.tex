\section{Featherweight Go}

\emph{Featherweight Go} is a small, functional, Turing-complete subset of the Go
programming language, introduced by \citeauthor{fg} for the purpose of showing
how generics can be added to the language (\citeyear{fg}). This section will
extend \emph{Featherweight Go} with arrays, as found in Go. In a similar
fashion, only a subset of array features are included to keep things manageable.
In particular, slices are excluded.

A couple of notes on formal notation: a bar above a term or group of terms
denotes a sequence or a rule to be applied to each element in the sequence. A
sequence may contain 0 or more instances of the terms. In actual programs,
various delimiters are required between terms in a sequence. Depending on the
construct, this is either a comma or a semicolon (interchangeable with a
newline), but these details are omitted from the formal rules. A box around a
syntactical term means it cannot appear in a normal user program, but can be
used internally during reduction. Rules or rule fragments appearing in grey have
been taken directly from the original \emph{Featherweight Go} \autocite{fg}
without any modification. The rules in black show the changes introduced when
extending the rules to include arrays.
