\subsection{More complex \kw{const} bounds}
\label{sec:proposal-appx-bounds}

What about when two distinct type parameters appear in a
``constant'' expression, such as in the (somewhat contrived) example below:

\golisting{./examples/expressions/difference.go}

This code is only safe to execute when $N \ge M$. This adds additional
complexity, as we need to extend our approach from before if we wish to pursue
the liberal approach. In the implicit model, the compiler would have to reject
all instantiations of the function where $N < M$. In the explicit model, the
slicing notation would be allowed to accept constant expressions, and since type
parameters are constant expressions, they could be used to explicitly constrain
the type parameters. Go already permits referencing other type parameters,
including the one that is being constrained, in the constraint of a type
parameter. The compiler would still need to verify that the bounds specified by
the programmer make the operation legal for all instantiations.

\golisting{./examples/expressions/differenceexplicit.go}

Another area of concern that may arise with the liberal approach is recursively
defined functions or types, where the numerical type parameter differs in each
recursive instantiation (as shown in figure \ref{fig:strange-arr-init}).
Attempting to monomorphise such code would lead to extreme code bloat, and
should not be allowed. In both the implicit and explicit models, this is a
non-issue, as without knowing how the function or type will behave at runtime,
there is no range of values \texttt{N} that would be guaranteed to not cause an
underflow/overflow, so such a function cannot be defined. E.g. if in
\texttt{newArrStrange} we give \texttt{N} an explicit upper bound of $x$, than
the compiler would complain, since within the body of the function
\texttt{newArrStrange} could be recursively called with a type argument of $x +
    1$, which exceeds the type parameter's upper bound.

\subsection{Slicing generic arrays}
\label{sec:proposal-appx-slice}

Since in the conservative model, we have no guarantees about the array bounds,
the only permitted slicing operation is \texttt{[:]}, which creates a slice of
the entire array. Just as with the index operation, if the programmer wishes to
move the bounds check to runtime, they can simply reslice the slice obtained
from \texttt{[:]}. It is worth noting, that as of Go 1.21, slicing a generic
variable that is constrained by a union of array types is forbidden (even
\texttt{[:]} is not allowed). The liberal approach could be used to set lower
bounds on array lengths to allow compile-time safe generic array slicing, other
than just \texttt{[:]}.

\subsection{The \texttt{len} function}
\label{sec:proposal-appx-len}

Go's built-in \texttt{len} function is special in the sense that depending on
the context, it may or may not be computed at compile time \autocite{spec}. If
it is computed at compile time, we can assign the result to a \kw{const}
variable, or use it in any other place that requires a compile-time constant
non-negative integer value, such as for the length of an array.

An example of a compile-time evaluation of \texttt{len} is when it is applied to
an array value literal, and an example of a run-time evaluation of \texttt{len}
is when it is applied to a slice value. The question arises, how should
\texttt{len} treat generic arrays (specifically, ones that are parameterised on
size)?

If we take Rust's conservative approach of prohibiting the use of expressions
that include constant type parameters (except when the expression is a lone type
parameter) as type arguments \autocite{rustConstBlog}, which include applying
\texttt{len} to a generically sized array, then it becomes clear why
\texttt{len} of a generically sized array should yield a non-constant integer
(as indeed is the case in Rust). Without this restriction, the compiler would
have to keep track of which constant was derived from an expression containing a
type-parameter, to prevent the later usage of such a constant in another
\kw{const} expression used as a type argument. The same logic applies to the
numerical type parameters themselves: if they could be assigned to constant
variables, then the constant variable could be used as part of a constant
expression used to instantiate a \kw{const} type parameter, leading to the
problems discussed in the previous section. And so, when \kw{const} type
parameters are used as values, the resulting expression type should be a
non-constant \kw{int} under the conservative model.

\begin{figure}
    \golisting{./examples/expressions/len.go}
    \caption{Expressions derived from a numerical type parameter are non-constant}
\end{figure}

If we view the generally sized arrays as the union of array types of all sizes
(similar to the explicitly enumerated array type union we can already represent
in code), then we can keep things as they are currently in Go. I.e. a generic
type bound by a union of arrays has a non-constant \texttt{len}.

\begin{figure}
    \golisting{./examples/werner/const_len_of_interface.go}
    \caption{As of Go 1.18, \texttt{len} of an array union type set interface
        value is non-constant}
\end{figure}

This is likely to avoid constraining the compiler implementation. With a full
monomorphisation approach, the \kw{const} of the example above is not an issue,
as each instantiation of the function has its own local \texttt{const n} with a
distinct value. However, in the current GC Shape Stenciling approach used by the
Go compiler as of Go 1.18 \autocite{generics1.18}, it is possible to construct a
union of array types that have the same GC shape, yet the length of the array
type differs. In such cases, \kw{const}s within a generic function would be
difficult or even impossible to handle correctly. A simpler explanation is that
generic types simply always have non-constant lengths (given \texttt{len} is
defined on all types of the type set), regardless of whether or not values of
their constraint type could yield a constant length \autocite{spec}.
