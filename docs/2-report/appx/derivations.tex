\section{Formal derivation examples}

\subsection{Featherweight Go with Arrays reduction}
\label{sec:fg-derivation-example}

Below are derivation trees reducing an example FGA expression down to a value.
Each reduction step in the example program has its own derivation tree.

\subsection{Featherweight Go with Arrays type checking}
\label{sec:fg-typing-derivation-example}

Below are derivation trees type checking two simple FGA programs, using a common set
of declarations. Since each type checking derivation tree would be too large to
fit on a single page, the trees have been split into multiple smaller subtrees.

\subsection{Featherweight Generic Go with Arrays type checking}
\label{sec:fgg-typing-derivation-example}

Below is a derivation tree type checking a simple FGGA program.

% TODO consider type checking second program, or removing e2 from the list of
% expressions

% TODO revisit all derivation trees once FGA and FGGA rules are stable
