# ECS635U - Project (Monorepo)

This monorepo contains all the work done as part of my undergraduate final year
project, from the initial proposals, to the implementation and report.

## Repo structure

The most important directories:

- [`projects/go-generic-array-sizes`](./projects/go-generic-array-sizes/)
  contains the code implementation, Go proposal drafts, and formal rules.
  Further information about the project can be found in the
  [readme](./projects/go-generic-array-sizes/README.md) in that directory.
- [`deliverables`](./deliverables/) contains the initial project definition,
presentation slides, and the writeup in LaTeX for the final report.

The other directories contain work from auxiliary/preliminary exercises.
