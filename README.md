# Go const generics

<!-- TODO give intro to project -->

This monorepo contains all the work done as part of my undergraduate final year
project, from the initial proposals, to the implementation and report.

<!-- TODO flatten README with src/README.md -->

## Repo structure

- [`src`](./src/) contains the code implementation, Go proposal drafts, and
  formal rules. Further information about the project can be found in the
  [readme](./src/README.md) in that directory.
- [`docs`](./docs/) contains the initial project definition, presentation
  slides, and the writeup in LaTeX for the final report.
